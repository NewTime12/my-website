	 <h1>The practicals</h1>
	 <h3>Convolutional neural networks<h3>
	 <p>Learn to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an important class of learnable representations applicable to 
	 numerous computer vision problems and are the main method for feature extraction in image understanding.
	 This practical explores the basic CNN building blocks (linear filters and ReLU), back-propagation, learning CNNs
	 to detect particular image structures as well as typewritten characters (using a variety of different fonts), and
	 using stochastic gradient descent with momentum, mini-batches, and data augmentation.</p>

	 <h1>Image classification</h1>
	 <p>Learn how to tell if an image contains an object of a certain class (e.g. a dog, a mountain, or a person). The challenge is to be invariant to irrelevant factors such as viewpoint and illumination as well as to the differences between objects (no two mountains look exactly the same). The practical covers using various deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract image features, learning an SVM classifier for five different object classes (airplanes, motorbikes, people, horses and cars), assessing its performance using precision-recall curves,
	 and training a new classifiers from data collected using Internet images.</p>

     <li><a href="">MATLAB pre-deep learning version (uses MATLAB and no ConvNets!)</a></li>
	 </ul>
	 <h1>Image retrieval</h1>
	 <p>Learn to recognize specific objects in images, such as the Notre Dame cathedral or `Starry Nightâ€™ by Van Gogh, by quickly matching a query to a large database. The challenge is to be invariant to changes in scale, camera viewpoint, illumination conditions and partial occlusion. The practical covers matching images using sparse SIFT features, geometric verification, feature quantization and bag-of-visual-words,
	 and evaluating a retrieval systems using mean average precision.</p>
